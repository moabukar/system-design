## System Design Introduction

- Let's break it down to the basics. Imagine system design as the blueprint for a building. Before you start building, you need a plan for how everything fits together, right? That's what system design is all about. It's all about laying out the plan for a system - this includes everything from the big picture, like how the system overall should work and interact with other systems, down to the nitty-gritty details, like how data is going to be stored and moved around.

Think of it as drawing up the plans for how all the parts of a machine will fit and work together before you start putting it together. This process makes sure that what you're building will meet the needs of your business or organization, making everything work smoothly and efficiently.

### The importance of system design

- Now, why is system design so important? Well, making these plans early on, when you're just starting out, helps you avoid big headaches later. If you've ever tried to change the foundation of a house after it's been built, you know what I mean. Decisions made in system design are like setting up the foundation for your project. They're tough to change down the road. Plus, having a solid design from the get-go makes it easier to tweak things as you go along, without having to start from scratch every time you want to make a change. It's all about setting yourself up for success from the start.
